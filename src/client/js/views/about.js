        I'm a front end developer, and passionate about it as it provides the opportunity to combine the 
        analytic with the creative. With a degree in Business Management and Computer Science from Oxford Brookes University,
        I am now looking for a role in front-end development to take my skills to the next level. My knowledge of languages include:
        <br/><br/>
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, PHP, Java, Python, XML and SVG.
        <br/><br/>
        In addition to this, I have experience using WordPress
        and proficient in Microsoft Office software. Digital marketing
        also piques my interest, with a qualification in Google Analytics and 
        understanding of building SEO-friendly websites.
